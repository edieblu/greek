I started learning Greek in January 2022 and am expected to be fully fluent by November 2022, when I'll be moving to Athens for work. So follow my language journey as I wrestle with Greek grammar and stumble over those long words with the hope of achieving some enlightenment on the way. It will for sure be quite a ride. ðŸŽ¢
