The structure of the "if" conditional is quite straightforward. Conditional sentences have two distinct parts:

If... -> then...

The sentences that expresses the condition to be fulfilled:

> αν + verb in future tense without θα

And the sentence that expresses the consequence, which could be in future, subjunctive or imperative.

**Realistic possibility, present and future tense**

Like in English, we can use conditionals to show the realistic consequences of an immediate/present action.

If I drink coffee now, I won't be able to sleep later.

Αν πιω καφέ τώρα, δεν θα μπορώ να κοιμιθώ αργότερα.

**Hypothetical, something that could've happened (but didn't)**

We can also express in retrospect what would've happened if we had made a differet action in the past.

If I had drunk coffee in the afternoon, I wouldn't be able to sleep now.

Αν είχα πιει καφέ το απόγευμα, τώρα δεν θα μπορούσα να κοιμιθώ.

Αν έπινα καφέ το απόγευμα, τώρα δεν θα μπορούσα να κοιμιθώ.

**To note**

> You can't put θα after αν

And here is an example in future, subjunctive and imperative:

Αν μιλήσεις με τη Μαρία, **θα** της πεις ότι την έψαχνα;

Αν μιλήσεις με τη Μαρία, **να** της πεις ότι την έψαχνα

Αν μιλήσεις με τη Μαρία, **πες** της ότι την έψαχνα 



If you want to learn a lot more - and I do mean a LOT - about conditionals in Modern Greek and how the structures are parallel to those in English, [you can read this paper  that uses The Lord of the Rings](https://ikee.lib.auth.gr/record/305223/files/Bigga.pdf) as the example illustrate how tense, aspect and conditionality behave in both languages.
