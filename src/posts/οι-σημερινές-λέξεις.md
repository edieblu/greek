1. **Έκπτωση** / εκπτώσεις: discounts (but can also mean overthrown, only referring to governments / royalty)\
   Comes from: η **πτώση** f (ptósi, “fall”)\
   Which comes from the Ancient Greek  πῑ́πτω (pī́ptō, “I fall”) +‎ -σῐς (-sis)\
   **πέφτω** is also related in origin  (Ancient Greek πίπτω píptō)  and πετάω as a coordinated term.

3. **ιδιατερότητα** (noun): distinctiveness, particularity. \
   Ίδιος + έταιρος (private/personal/pertaining to one's self + different)\
   **ιδιαίτερος/η/ο** (adjective): special, private, peculiar, individual\
   **ιδιαίτερα** (adverb): in particular, especially\
   They all come from idios - pertaining to one's self\

4. **προσφορά**, προσφορές: offer(s)\
   **προσφέρω**: I offer - and one can notice the similarities of pr-osfero, osfero, offer\
   Also relared to this word:\

5. **συγριτικός**: comparative, and therefore **συγκρίνω**, to compare. \
   Frustratingly, I haven't found much about the origin of these words. \
   At a stretch, **συγκρίνω** is related to κρίνω (to judge, assess, consider, determine) which is in turn also related to the Latin root "cerno" (to discern, to compare).\
   One could say that to compare is to judge in a way, so that'll be my anchor.
