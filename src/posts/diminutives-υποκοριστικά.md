A feature shared between one of my native languages (Spanish) and Greek is the widespread use of diminutives. 

Many Spanish speakers say that they can recognise Central Americans based solely on the amount of diminutives we manage to squeeze into any given sentence.

I'm happy to confirm we do. Wherever there's a noun, there's a possibility of adding <ito, ita>. Sometimes it's to express endearment (hijita, perrito, solecito, vasito, salsito), sometimes it's to show how innocuous something is (una copita, una fumadita, una mordidita, un golpecito, una cosita de nada) and sometimes it's a thing of its own that has acquired a standalone meaning, [like the infamous "ahorita". ](https://doorwaytomexico.com/paulina/ahorita-meaning-examples/)
