The title in Greek should give this away: I'm not sure what is the specific name for this part of speech (ότι, πως, που) is in English, but I'm currently learning them as connectors of independent or independent+dependent sentences.

Both ότι and πως (without a stress) can be translated as "that" and we can stick it right after a verb to introduce subordinate special clauses.

Verbs that accept a special clause (with the connectors that/as) as object are:

* Verbs denoting linguistic expression.
* Verbs denoting knowledge and feeling.

Namely:

Ξέρο (I know)\
Γνωρίζω (I reckon)\
Έιμα σίγουρος (I'm sure)\
Έιμαι βέβαιος (I'm certain)\
Βλέπω (I see)\
Παρατηρώ (I observe)\
Νομίζω (I think)\
Πιστεύω (I believe)\
Θεωρώ (I believe, I find)\
Μου φαίνεται (It seems to me)\
Καταλαβαίνω (I understand)\
Σκέφτομαι (I think)\
Αρνούμαι (I deny)\
Μαθαίνω (I learn, but can be used as <I just heard that> or <I just saw that>, like in English)\
Λέω (I say, but in this case it means <I'm thinking to, I'm planning to>)\
Αναφέρω (I report)\
Ισχυρίζομαι (I assert)\
Υποστηρίζω (I support)

A few examples are:
