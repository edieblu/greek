Today's frog is the past perfect - υπερσυντέλικος. 

If you're wondering how this blog went from [Hello World!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) to complex verb tenses, let's just say I've spent the last 3 months in a whirlwind of changes, from becoming a full-time language student, to moving to the countryside living out of yet-to-be-unpacked boxes.

I don't feel inclined to unpack, given that the true adventure (not that living surrounded by cows isn't *a type* of adventure) is just around the corner: our great trek to Athens in November.

I'm sure that by then this much will be true:

> Δεν είχα τελειώσει το ξεπακετάρισμα όταν έπρεπε να μετακομίσω ξανά.

*I hadn't finished unpacking when I had to move again.*

Today's lesson is how to form the past perfect, which is straightforward if you've mastered your verb ["to have"](https://helinika.com/2020/10/27/modern-greek-verb-to-have-conjugation/) in past tense ακα *αόριστος* (έχω / είχα) and the third person singular of all other verbs in the future :) 

> Υπερσυντέλικος = είχα (είχες, είχε, [κτλ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BA%CF%84%CE%BB)) + απλός μέλλοντας (εσύ)

Like in English, we use the υπερσυντέλικος to denote an action that has happened in the past (usually a long time ago):

* before another action happened, or / πριν από μια άλλη πράξη ή
* before a particular or specified moment in time / πριν από κάποια συγκεκριμένη χρονική στιγμή που λέγεται ή που εννοείται

For example:

Όταν φτάσαμε στις Βρυξέλλες, όλα τα καταστήματα είχαν κλείσει.

*When we arrived to Brussels, all the shops had closed.* (It was a Sunday, it happens, you need to live it to believe it) 

Μέχρι χθες δεν είχα κουρευτεί για δύο χρόνια.

*Until yesterday I hadn't cut my hair in two years* (maybe even longer, judging by the horrified look of the hairdresser)

Είχα κάνει ένα φανταστικό ταξίδι στην Πορτογαλία πέρυσι και ήμουν πολύ ευχαριστημένη.

*I had a fantastic trip to Portugal last year and I was very happy.* 

If you think some of these sentences are unnecesary and you'd get along just fine with αόριστος, I wholeheartedly agree. But if you need to sit a B1-B2 test (like [εμένα](https://www.greekpod101.com/blog/2020/08/24/greek-pronouns/)), then I hope these resources help and tips help.

Key words to look out for:

* ήδη / already
* κιολάς / already
* ακόμη or ακόμα / even, still
* Πριν από (χ χρόνια) / before x years
* Όταν / when

[This PDF ](https://www.greekgrammar.eu/pdffiles/pastperf.pdf)gives you the whole explanation, with thanks to the author who published it.

And lastly, here's my favourite teacher explaining the past perfect. I highly recommend her videos, and she really does answer to questions in the comments.
