Today's frog is the past perfect - υπερσυντέλικος. 

If you're wondering how this blog went from [Hello World!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) to complex verb tenses, let's just say I've spent the last 3 months in a whirlwind of changes, from becoming a full-time language student, to moving to the countryside living out of yet-to-be-unpacked boxes.

I don't feel inclined to unpack, given that the true adventure (not that living surrounded by cows isn't *a type* of adventure) is just around the corner: our great trek to Athens in November.

I'm sure that by then this much will be true:

> Δεν είχα τελειώσει το ξεπακετάρισμα όταν έπρεπε να μετακομίσω ξανά.

*I hadn't finished unpacking when I had to move again.*

Today's lesson is how to form the past perfect, which is straightforward if you've mastered your verb ["to have"](https://helinika.com/2020/10/27/modern-greek-verb-to-have-conjugation/) in past tense (έχω / είχα) and the third person singular of all other verbs in the future :) 

Here's my favourite online teacher explaining the past perfect. I highly recommend her videos, and she really does answer to questions in the comments.
